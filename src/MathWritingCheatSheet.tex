        \section*{Proofs and Justifications}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{To prove this, we proceed as follows...}

            \item \textit{A key distinction between these cases is that...}
            \item \textit{While \( X \) holds in general, it does not necessarily imply \( Y \).}

        \section*{Example and Counterexample}

            \item \textit{As an example, consider the function...}
